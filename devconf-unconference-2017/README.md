in the Kubernetes context.

More details on: <https://kubevirt.io>


# Location
The event is on the 2nd Floor of the FIT, Room C236.

We will also be offering a BlueJeans link for remote people and take recordings of the sessions.


# Schedule

**Note.** The official devconf.cz schedule is available here <https://devconf.cz/schedule.html>.

Every session can be up to 60min. A good rule of thumb is to plan for 45min.
Where 5-15min can be slides and the remaining time can be used for discussion.
