# Title

Moving a Visual Effects Studio to the cloud with Kubernetes and KubeVirt

# Abstract

As the rapid transition to remote work happened, VFX studios and designers used to beefy workstations, on-site storage clusters and high performance networking have had to scramble to make those resources available to people at home.

This presentation details how a VFX studio with 60 designers transitioned from a fully on-prem environment to complete cloud workflow. Combining KubeVirt powered Virtual Workstations with render nodes and storage running natively in Kubernetes provided a solution that beat expectations. Being able to manage all components via the same Kubernetes API allowed for a quick integration into existing systems.

We will be discussing our experience integrating KubeVirt under a strict deadline while leveraging bleeding edge features such as Virtio-FS.
