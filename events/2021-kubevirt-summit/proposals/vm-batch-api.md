# Virtual Machine Batch API

# Abstract
KubeVirt extends the Kubernetes ReplicaSets API to provide Virtual Machines with
similar functionality and the same can be done with Kubernetes Jobs.  In order
to bulk schedule VirtualMachines, an admin could use a VirtualMachine Batch API,
a VirtualMachineJob, to launch many VirtualMachines from a single API call.
In this session, weâ€™d like to share ideas, discuss use cases, and consider
possible solutions to bulk Virtual Machine scheduling.
