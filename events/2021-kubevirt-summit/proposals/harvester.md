# Title

Harvester: an Open Source HCI solution built on Kubernetes and KubeVirt

# Abstract

Project Harvester is a new open source alternative to traditional proprietary
hyperconverged infrastructure software. It is built on top of cutting-edge open
source technologies including Kubernetes, KubeVirt and Longhorn.

In this talk, we will talk about why we decide to build Harvester, how did we
integrated with KubeVirt, and the lessons we've learnt along the way. We will
also have a demo of current release of Harvester by the end of session.
