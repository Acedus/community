# Title

Zero Downtime KubeVirt Updates

# Abstract

KubeVirt has a very precise and resilient method for ensuring zero downtime
updates occur. In this session I'll cover the general strategy behind how
we approach updating KubeVirt from a developer's perspective as well as
discuss future improvments to our update process.

Attendees will come away with an understanding of how KubeVirt's update
process has been designed, how it is tested, and what future enhancements
are coming soon.
