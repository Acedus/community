# Title

How to avoid merging broken code with automated testing using prow

# Abstract

This session is about creation of prow jobs in general. [Prow](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/blob/master/prow/README.md) is a Kubernetes based CI/CD system.

We will cover
- what is a prow job
- what job types are available
- how to configure job triggers
- testing jobs: requirements, obstacles and pitfalls
- configurations for merge gating
- other usages of jobs (publishing, bumping, ...)

Attendants will be able to know what job types are available, which one to use for a specific problem and how to verify their job works on their machine (TM) before creating a PR.
